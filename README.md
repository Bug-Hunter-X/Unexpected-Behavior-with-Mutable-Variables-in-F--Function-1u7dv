This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F# when working with mutable variables within functions.  The `swap` function intends to exchange the values of `x` and `y`. However, due to F#'s scoping rules and how mutable variables are handled, the values are not swapped correctly in the original variables outside the function. The solution shows how to correctly implement value swapping and explains the underlying behavior.
